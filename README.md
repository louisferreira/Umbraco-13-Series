This is the repository for the Umbraco 13 Tutorial Series by Paul Seal

In this repo you will find the code that I produce when recording the tutorials.

The code gets committed at the end of each episode and tags are created for you so you can get to the same code that I used in the episode and so you have a starting point if you want to come in at a certain episode.
